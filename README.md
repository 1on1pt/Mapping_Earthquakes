# Mapping_Earthquakes
Using the Leaflet.js Application Programming Interface (API) to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL. This interactive map will show each earthquake that occurred in the past seven days and will be visually represented by a circle and color, where a higher magnitude will have a larger diameter and be darker in color. In addition, each earthquake will have a popup marker that, when clicked, will show the magnitude and location of the earthquake.
