# Mapping_Earthquakes
Using the Leaflet.js Application Programming Interface (API) to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL. This interactive map will show each earthquake that occurred in the past seven days and will be visually represented by a circle and color, where a higher magnitude will have a larger diameter and be darker in color. In addition, each earthquake will have a popup marker that, when clicked, will show the magnitude and location of the earthquake.

## Overview of the Project
Basil and Sadhana like how the original earthquake map was created with two different maps (Streets and Satellite) and the Earthquake overlay. Now, Basil and Sadhana would like to see the interactive map updated to include: (1) earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth; (2) display all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5; and (3) show the data on a third map *style*.
